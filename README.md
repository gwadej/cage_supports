Cage Supports
=============

When building cages for rabbits out of various forms of wire mesh, you often
find a need for raising the mesh slightly off the surface.

These models were constructed to make cleaning the bnny areas a little easier.

Print one corner piece for each corner you need to support. Print the straight
pieces for long runs or for corners that are part of doors.
